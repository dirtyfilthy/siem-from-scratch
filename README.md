    v0.1.0 INITIAL RELEASE 2020-08-24 -- Caleb Anderson dirtyfilthee@gmail.com

This project creates a drop in ELK SIEM component for use in a infosec redteam lab. It will install the ELK stack, register a trial, create TLS certificates, setup users, setup beat index templates etc etc. (see "Activities"). This is not designed to replace the excellent DetectionLab (https://github.com/clong/DetectionLab), but instead provide an easy to use, low configuration, drop-in component you can integrate into existing labs or use as part of custom redteam scenarios. 

To create a complete lab the only thing required should be to install beats agents on boxes and point them at the SIEM. 

Assuming the machine image exists and the resources have already been downloaded, the SIEM itself takes about five minutes to provision.

## Prerequisites

As the shell scripts and necessary tools are run on the created SIEM box itself, this software has limited requirements:

* Vagrant
* Vagrant project folder shared under "/vagrant" or "C:\Vagrant" (this is usually the case by default)
* Internet connection

The example VagrantFile is setup to work with VirtualBox but the provisioning scripts should work with any provider. 

## Quickstart

This quickstart example will start up a SIEM and one Windows box which it will monitor. You'll create a detection event and see this event get picked up in the SIEM.

It is recommended to quickstart the project at least once to create the SIEM root cert and download all the resources it requires. If you then copy this "siem/" folder into your lab folders in future you will not need to re-install any certificates or re-download any resources.

Take a look at the example VagrantFile in an editor. Note that it's going to create the SIEM at 172.28.128.20 and the monitored Windows server at 172.28.128.21. It's also going to install two elastic Beats agents on the Windows server and point the logging output of those agents at the SIEM.

Exit the editor, then change to the toplevel directory of the project in a shell and run the following command 

    vagrant up

Install the created root certificate at "siem/certs/myca/myCA.crt". 

Note this certificate is created only once (unless you delete it), and you will need to install it only once as well. If you are going to use SIEM-from-scratch in a lab, it's best to copy the whole "siem/" directory with the created certificates included, so that you don't need to keep installing root certificates over and over. 

SSH into the Windows monitored box

    vagrant ssh monitored

Then run the "whoami" command and exit

    whoami
    exit

This will create an event for the SIEM to detect.

Navigate to https://172.28.128.20:5601/ in a browser and login with user "elastic" and password "Password1" (no quotes with either username or password).

Click on "Detections"

You should see a "Whoami Process Event" in the Trends and in the alerts table below. Note that the detection rule runs every five minutes, so you may need to wait a few minutes and hit the "Refresh" button to see it appear.


More information on the elastic SIEM is available here https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/siem/guide/current/index.html


## Lab Use

Copy the "siem/" folder into the vagrant directory of your lab. Edit your VagrantFile to include the SIEM_IP and SIEM_CN at the top:

    SIEM_IP   = "172.28.128.20"
    SIEM_CN   = "siem.lab"

Change the IP and hostname to whatever is desired for your lab.

Include the following lines within the "Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|" section to provision the SIEM virtual machine:


    config.vm.define "siem" do |cfg|
        cfg.vm.box = "ubuntu/xenial64"
        cfg.vm.hostname = "siem"
        cfg.vm.network :private_network, ip: SIEM_IP
        cfg.vm.provision "shell", path: "siem/scripts/debian-install-siem-one-line.sh", args: [SIEM_CN, SIEM_IP]
        cfg.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb, override|
          vb.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--memory", 4096]
          vb.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--cpus", 2]
          vb.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--clipboard-mode", "bidirectional"]
        end
    end

You can copy this from the example VagrantFile in the project directory. A more granular example VagrantFile is provided at "VagrantFile.verbose" if you need more control over the provisioning process.

## Beats Agents

Beats are the datashippers for the siem. The SIEM is configured to accept logstash input from beats agents on SIEM_IP:5044, no encryption is configured. More information about beats can be found at https://www.elastic.co/beats/

For convenience, a number of Windows and Debian Beats agent install scripts are provided under "siem/installers". These include installers for auditbeat, packetbeat and filebeat; and the windows only winlogbeat. Each provision script takes one argument, the IP of the SIEM. 

The auditbeat and winlogbeat installers should work without further configuration, as will the debian packetbeat installer. Packetbeat may require configuration of the interface under Windows, edit the "siem/conf/packetbeat/packetbeat-win.yml" file to configure this. Filebeat should mostly work under Debian but Windows will need to edit the "siem/conf/filebeat/filebeat-win.yml" file to point the location of logfiles.

The Windows installers presume the use of powershell and the Vagrant WinRM communicator.

To use an installer add a line like the following in to your Vagrant machine definition in the 'config.vm.define "machine" do cfg' section:

    cfg.vm.provision "shell", path: "siem/installers/windows-install-winlogbeat.ps1", args: "172.28.128.20"

changing "172.28.128.20" to the IP of your SIEM 

### Root Certificate

The first time "vagrant up" is run, a root cert will be created in "siem/certs/myca/myCA.crt". You'll need to install this locally on whatever machine you are using to access the Kibana SIEM dashboard. 

### SIEM Dashboard

The dashboard will become available on https://SIEM_IP:5601/

The default username and password is elastic / Password1


## Configuration

The SIEM is setup to work out of the box. In general the only thing you should need to change are the SIEM_CN and SIEM_IP in the VagrantFile -- however further customisation is possible under the conf/ directory. 

* SIEM_IP: set this to the IP address of the SIEM
* SIEM_CN: set this to the FQDN of the SIEM


If you want to use your own root certificate, you will need edit conf/siem/config.sh and set ROOTCERT, as well as create and sign .key, .p12 and .crt files and set the appropiate variables. 

* ./conf/siem/config.sh is a sourced shell file with major options. 
    * ELKVERSION is the version of the ELK stack to install
    * ROOTCERT is the vagrant inside the project of the root certificate to use (autogenerated on first run)
    * ELASTICSEARCH_* are the certificate .key, .p12 and .crt files to use for the kibana interface and elasticsearch api (autogenerated on first run)
    * SETUPLOCALBEATS is set to true if beats agents are to be run on the SIEM itself. (disabled by default, enable it if you want to create some data without spinning up another box)
    * INSTALL_DASHBOARDS controls the installation of regular kibana dashboards (useless for SIEM, disabled by default)
* ./conf/elasticsearch/jvm.options will allow you configure elasticsearch memory 
* ./conf/auditbeat/\*, ./conf/filebeat/\*, ./conf/packetbeat/\* etc are the config files for the local beat agent setup

## Activities

The provisioning scripts will perform the following actions:

* create a root certificate and a create a signed sub certificate 
* download all required files (such as elasticsearch .deb packages etc) into ./resources
* install Java 
* install root certificate 
* install elasticsearch, kibana and logstash
* configure elasticsearch to use the created certs
* register elasticsearch for platinum trial
* create elasticsearch users
* configure kibana with created certs and users
* configure logstash with created certs and users
* install index templates and kibana dashboards for auditbeat, filebeat, packetbeat and winlogbeat
* create SIEM signal index
* install default detection rules
* enable default detection rules
* set SIEM dashboard as kibana homepage

## Caveats

I am not a SIEM expert and I have never worked on the blueteam in any capacity -- in fact I am actually a complete beginner when it comes to incident response. This project was born purely out of a desire to see what sort of signals my actions on the redteam would create, and to "scratch an itch" of having a SIEM easily available to place in my labs.

Without a doubt, this project will contain many glaring omissions and errors that are entirely obvious to anyone skilled in the art. For this I apologise in advance, however any feedback, suggestions, pull requests or raised issues are gratefully accepted.

## Gotchas

### Statically Bundled Winlogbeat Index Template

Unlike other beat shippers, currently there is no way of generating the winlogbeat index template dynamically from within linux.  This means it has been bundled with the project statically. If you change ELKVERSION you will need to regenerate this file by running the following commands within powershell:

    $VERSION=7.9.0
    .\winlogbeat.exe export template --es.version $VERSION | Out-File -Encoding UTF8 "/vagrant/conf/winlogbeat/winlogbeat-$VERSION.template.json"

replacing the 7.9.0 on the $VERSION= line with your ELK version.

You should copy the generated template file to .siem/conf/winlogbeat/
